#To you who may be reading this 
#Ruin has come to our localisation file.


#You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial, gazing separatly from the other files causing no issues with the github.


#I typed down all my most schizophhrenic additions in that ancient rumor-shadowed file, fattened by easy merges and no grammer. And yet, I began to tire of... conventional #extravagance. Singular unsettling tales suggested that pdx itself was reworking the very things we were reworking .

#With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the reading and discovery of those new dev-diaries, exhausting what remained of my attention span on... the ottomans and... memes. At last, in the salt-soaked scrolling beneath the latest updates, we unearthed that damnable entry of antediluvian evil. Our every rework was being done by paradox we treied to pray the next updte wouldnt be on one we worked on, but we were in a realm of johan and madness! In the end, I alone was left with my ideas and concepts to host a game in the mean time.


#You remember our venerable file, opulent and imperial. It is a festering abomination! I beg you, return home, claim your birthright, and deliver our server from the ravenous clutching shadows [hammer cocks, gunshot, loud thud sound]... of the darkest localisation file.
